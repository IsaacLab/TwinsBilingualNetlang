<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This corpus contains a set of files collected by Heidi Feldman and colleagues
at Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh. The children included are either
participants who have experienced some form of brain lesion or the normal
controls for these children. There are two main studies. The first set of files
is a part of the “narrative study” with children aged 4 to 7 that used picture
book story-telling procedures to elicit narrative descriptions. The second
study, the “PC” study, looked at younger children using the procedures of the
New England study (Ninio, Snow, Pan, & Rollins, 1996). In addition to these two
major studies, there was a study of two twin pairs with one child with using
both the methods of the PC study and, later, the narrative tasks. 

<p>The data for the twin study comes from two sets of twins in which one twin
suffered early brain damage and the other did not.
